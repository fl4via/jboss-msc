/**
 * OptionalDependencyDecorator.<br>This class establishes a transitive dependency relationship between the
 * dependent and the real dependency. The intermediation performed by this class adds the required optional
 * behavior to the dependency relation, by:
 * <ul>
 * <li> notifying the dependent that it is satisfied if dependency is not installed</li>
 * <li> once the real dependency is installed, if there is a demand previously added by the dependent, this dependency
 *      does not start forwarding the notifications to the dependent, meaning that the dependent won't even be aware
 *      that the dependency is down</li>
 * <li> waits for the dependency to be satisfied and the dependent to be down, so it can finally start forwarding
 *      notifications in both directions (from dependency to dependent and vice-versa)</li>
 * </ul>
